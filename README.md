- [MoEngage](https://app.moengage.com/)
- [AppsFlyer](https://hq1.appsflyer.com/auth/login)

### Features

The tool should have the following features:

- Click and activity tracking
- Ad campaign creation and management
- Campaign performance analysis and ROI calculation
- Customization of user reach segments
- White label solution for branding and reselling

### Format

Please provide the list of features in an Excel file using the following columns:

- Feature: a short description of the feature
- Module: the module to which the feature belongs (e.g. Dashboard, Ad Campaign Management, Performance Metrics, etc.)
- Sub-Module: the sub-module to which the feature belongs (if applicable)
- Task: a specific task or action related to the feature
- Remarks: any additional notes or comments related to the feature

The list is not exhaustive and can be modified based on the project requirements.



## One of our Partners wants to build a Mobile Solution for streamlining their business.

Please provide out the features of the mobile application in bulleted points, there isn’t any constraint on the features limit. Try to figure out more and more possible & logical features in an application keeping all types of Users (3 types) in mind.

### Introduction to the Project 2

One of the FMCG wants to create an engagement app for his/her Grocers, where FMCG executives can track the Trial History of the Sample Goods referred by the Grocers to their end customers.

Brief Intent of the Business: Before the Covid 19 pandemic, the salesman of the FMCG used to reach out to the Grocery Shops/Pan Shop Owners and provide them the samples of their product. Once the sample is shared with the Grocer, the Grocer pitches his/her consumer to use the product of the desired FMCG company and provide them the coupon code along as well. Using the coupon code the consumer calls on a helpline no. and enters out that coupon code and is tracked down by the FMCG personnels. Using the unique coupon codes the agency was able to track down the performance of the Groccers.

This model is known as the (Hub and Spoke model)

Problem Statement: We need to create a mobile solution to streamline the complete process. We need to figure out how we can share the coupon code with the Shop Owners and figure out how they are performing i.e. if they are pitching their customers to purchase my goods or not. It doesn’t stop here our major pain point is the motivation factor for the Owners to install and use the app, this whole process should be gamified and there should be a provision for the gratifications as well. Some of the gratification we used to provide in the past were Foreign Trips to the best performing Grocers likewise.

Some Key Points outlined are:

- Engagement platform for the FMCG sales person to outreach to the retailers under his/her Geographical location
- Engagement Platform for the Grocers and Shop owners to receive the Coupon codes and his daily / Weekly / Monthly milestones that needs to be covered
- Sales Person will share a coupon code with the retailers through the app designed for him, Coupon code will be used for tracking the sales performed by the retailers
- Retailers will share the coupon code with the customers and will ask them to perform the required step such as calling on a desired no. and adding out this code so that the FMCG can track out the sales made
- Gratification process for the retailers so that they can engage more with the application // Figure out the pain points of the retailer and we can suggest out some gratification like Cashback, share some more possible gratification points

Prepare a Product features Doc highlighting out the complete journey for the three Users: Grocers, Admin, & Sales Person.
