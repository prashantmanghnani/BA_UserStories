## Tracking Tool White Label Solution

### Project Introduction

We need to create a tracking tool that allows us to track clicks and other activities on our website, as well as create and manage ad campaigns. The tool should provide us with data to analyze campaign performance, calculate ROI, and customize user reach segments.

We want to launch this tool as a white label solution, similar to Facebook Analytics, MoEngage, or AppsFlyer. Here are the weblinks for reference:

- [Facebook Analytics](https://analytics.facebook.com/)
- [MoEngage](https://app.moengage.com/)
- [AppsFlyer](https://hq1.appsflyer.com/auth/login)

### Features

The tool should have the following features:

- Click and activity tracking
- Ad campaign creation and management
- Campaign performance analysis and ROI calculation
- Customization of user reach segments
- White label solution for branding and reselling

### Format

Please provide the list of features in an Excel file using the following columns:

- Feature: a short description of the feature
- Module: the module to which the feature belongs (e.g. Dashboard, Ad Campaign Management, Performance Metrics, etc.)
- Sub-Module: the sub-module to which the feature belongs (if applicable)
- Task: a specific task or action related to the feature
- Remarks: any additional notes or comments related to the feature

The list is not exhaustive and can be modified based on the project requirements.
