## Tracking Tool White Label Solution

### Project Introduction 1

We need to create a tracking tool that allows us to track clicks and other activities on our website, as well as create and manage ad campaigns. The tool should provide us with data to analyze campaign performance, calculate ROI, and customize user reach segments.

We want to launch this tool as a white label solution, similar to Facebook Analytics, MoEngage, or AppsFlyer. Here are the weblinks for reference:

- [Facebook Analytics](https://analytics.facebook.com/)
- [MoEngage](https://app.moengage.com/)
- [AppsFlyer](https://hq1.appsflyer.com/auth/login)

### Features

The tool should have the following features:

- Click and activity tracking
- Ad campaign creation and management
- Campaign performance analysis and ROI calculation
- Customization of user reach segments
- White label solution for branding and reselling

### Format

Please provide the list of features in an Excel file using the following columns:

- Feature: a short description of the feature
- Module: the module to which the feature belongs (e.g. Dashboard, Ad Campaign Management, Performance Metrics, etc.)
- Sub-Module: the sub-module to which the feature belongs (if applicable)
- Task: a specific task or action related to the feature
- Remarks: any additional notes or comments related to the feature

The list is not exhaustive and can be modified based on the project requirements.




##Project Description 2
One of our partners in the FMCG industry wants to develop a mobile solution to streamline their business. The goal is to create a project plan and identify the features that will be included in both the mobile application and the business backend. We need to come up with a list of features for the mobile application, without any constraints on the number of features. We should keep all types of users in mind, including three types of users.

##Introduction to the Project
The FMCG partner wants to create an engagement app for their grocers, where FMCG executives can track the trial history of sample goods referred by grocers to their end customers.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the FMCG company's salespeople used to provide samples of their product to grocery store and pan shop owners. The grocers would then pitch the product to their customers, providing them with a coupon code. Using this code, the consumer would call a helpline number, enter the coupon code, and be tracked by FMCG personnel. This process allowed the agency to track the performance of the grocers.

The FMCG company wants to streamline this process and create a mobile solution to track coupon codes, monitor the performance of grocers, and motivate them to use the app.

###Problem Statement
We need to create a mobile solution to streamline the entire process, including sharing coupon codes with shop owners and monitoring their performance. We need to motivate grocers to install and use the app, which should be gamified, and include gratifications such as foreign trips to the best-performing grocers.

###Key Points
An engagement platform for FMCG salespeople to reach out to the retailers in their geographical location
An engagement platform for grocers and shop owners to receive coupon codes and monitor their daily, weekly, and monthly milestones
Salespeople can share coupon codes with retailers through the app designed for them, and the codes will be used to track the sales made by the retailers
Retailers will share coupon codes with customers, and the FMCG company can track the sales made
A gratification process for retailers to engage more with the application, including possible rewards like cashback

###Product Features
We need to prepare a product features document that outlines the complete journey for three types of users: grocers, admin, and salespeople. This document should detail the features of the mobile application and the business backend.
